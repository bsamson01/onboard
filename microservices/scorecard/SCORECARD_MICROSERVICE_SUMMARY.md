## 📊 Scoring Algorithm Details

### Score Calculation Formula
```
Final Score = min(1000, max(0, Base Score + Income Adjustment))

Base Score Components:
- Starting Score: 500
- Age Factor: +50 (optimal 25-55), +25 (18-24, 56-65), 0 (others)
- Employment Status: +100 (employed), +75 (self-employed), -100 (unemployed)
- Employment Duration: +75 (24+ months), +50 (12-23), +25 (6-11), -50 (<3)
- Banking Relationship: +50 (has account), +25 (checking account)
- Existing Loans: +25 (none), -25 to -100 (based on count)
- Risk Factors: Variable adjustments based on stability metrics

Income Adjustments:
- $10,000+: +100
- $7,500-9,999: +75
- $5,000-7,499: +50
- $3,000-4,999: +25
- $2,000-2,999: 0
- $1,000-1,999: -25
- <$1,000: -50
```

### Grade Mapping
- **AA (900-1000)**: Excellent - Best rates and terms
- **A (800-899)**: Very Good - Competitive rates
- **B (700-799)**: Good - Standard loan products
- **C (600-699)**: Fair - Basic products with higher rates
- **D (0-599)**: Poor - May require additional documentation/co-signer
