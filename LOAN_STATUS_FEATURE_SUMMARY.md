# 📦 Loan Application Status Management & Tracking - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive loan application status management and tracking system that provides:
- **Unified status lifecycle** from application creation to completion
- **Role-based status transitions** with proper permissions
- **Immutable audit logging** of all status changes
- **Customer portal** for tracking application progress
- **Admin dashboard** for managing applications
- **One active application per customer** enforcement

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔄 Status Lifecycle Management

**Application Statuses:**
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Application not yet submitted (replaces DRAFT)
- `SUBMITTED` - User completed onboarding, awaiting review
- `UNDER_REVIEW` - Staff member actively reviewing
- `APPROVED` - Approved by staff
- `AWAITING_DISBURSEMENT` - Approved but funds not yet disbursed
- `DONE` - Funds disbursed and process completed
- `REJECTED` - Rejected by staff, with visible reason
- `CANCELLED` - Manually cancelled by user

### 👥 Role-Based Permissions

**Customer Actions:**
- Submit application (IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED)
- Cancel application (IN_PROGRESS/SUBMITTED → CANCELLED)
- View own application status and history

**Staff Actions (Admin/Loan Officers/Risk Officers):**
- Start review (SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW)
- Approve/Reject applications
- Move to disbursement phase
- Complete disbursement (AWAITING_DISBURSEMENT → DONE)

**Admin-Only Actions:**
- Override decisions (rare cases)
- Access full statistics and reporting

### 🛡️ Business Logic Enforcement

**Status Transition Rules:**
- Strict validation of allowed transitions based on user role
- Prevention of invalid state changes (e.g., REJECTED → UNDER_REVIEW)
- Automatic timestamp updates for key milestones
- Reason requirements for rejections and cancellations

**One Active Application Rule:**
- Customers can only have one active application at a time
- Enforced at both API and database levels
- Clear messaging when trying to create duplicate applications

### 📊 Audit & History Tracking

**ApplicationStatusHistory Model:**
- Immutable record of every status change
- Captures who made the change, when, and why
- Includes IP address and user agent for security
- Differentiates between system, user, and admin actions

**Audit Integration:**
- Automatic logging to existing audit service
- Comprehensive tracking for compliance and troubleshooting
